# Slack Inviter API

The file [`slack-invite.js`](./slack-invite.js) implements an OpenWhisk action
which uses the [Slack invite API](https://api.slack.com/methods/admin.users.invite)
to send an email invitation to join the OpenWhisk Slack team.

The action requires a [Slack token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#user)
to work correctly.

The API call is made in [`_layouts/slack.html`](../_layouts/slack.html) using
anonymous action invocation hosted on [DigitalOcean Functions](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/functions). The token for
the API call is uniquely encrypted for this action. Should this token change,
the encrypted value can be regenerated with the following encryption API,
replacing the placeholder `<token>` with the actual Slack App token.

```bash
curl https://encrypt.nimbella.io/run/encrypt/github.com/apache/openwhisk-website/blob/master/apis/slack-invite.js?slacktoken=<token>
```
